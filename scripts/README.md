# Overview

This folder contains Python scripts we used to run differential abundance tests with SCDCdm. 
We used these scripts to evaluate the differential abundance in cell populations from the human large intestine as published in Smillie et al., Cell (2019). 
The original publication annotated 51 cell types in the Epithelium and the underlying Lamina Propria. Due to the large number of cell types, we tested several chain lengths 
for the HMC sampling.
